          <h2>More About Different Coding Languages</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          There are lots of different types of coding languages. In this section, I will give you more info about the most important ones.

            <h3 class="text-primary">Python</h3>
            <p class="text-secondary">
              Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language mainly based on C and C++. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected.

            <h3 class="text-primary">Java</h3>
            <p class="text-secondary">
              Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based and object-oriented and is mainly based on C and C++. The programming language is structured so that developers can write code anywhere and run it anywhere without worrying about the underlying computer architecture.

            <h3 class="text-primary">C++</h3>
            <p class="text-secondary">
              We have talked a lot about C++, so now I will tell you it is. C++ is one of the most difficult programming languages to learn over other popular languages like Python and Java (Which I have already spoken about). C++ is hard to learn because of its multi-paradigm nature and more advanced syntax.
